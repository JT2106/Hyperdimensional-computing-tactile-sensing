activeAM: trained AM for object identification.
itemHVs: encoded HVs of each object obtained during real-time experiments.               
raw_disp: raw features in displacements, used for t-SNE visualization. This is also the initial real-valued data to obtain itemHVs (see the HDL code in "d_active" folder for detailed encoding process).

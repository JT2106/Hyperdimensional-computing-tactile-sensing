real-time data from the motion capture system are in the folders:
	M1: PTFE surface
	M2: rubber surface
	M3: felt surface

	H: heavy box
	L: light box

grip_force_data: real-time data obtained from the tactile sensor (processed through the FPGA), including grip-force data, slip labels, and encoded HVs for slip detection (see the HDL code in "d_control_gripper" folder for detailed process).
